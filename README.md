# Extension Disabler
The purpose of this extension is to quickly turn on/off the extensions we set in the code.

## How its works?
In the popup.js file;
```
const extensionIds = ["xxx", "yyy", "zzz"];
```
write extension Id's that you want to disabled.

Then turn on developer mode in chrome extensions tab and drag the project folder to the tab.
